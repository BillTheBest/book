# DB Instance

>A DB instance is an isolated database environment running in the cloud. It is the basic building block of Amazon RDS. A DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases (SQL Server only allows one database per DB instance), and can be accessed using the same client tools and applications you might use to access a stand-alone database instance.

You can create new blank DB instance or create from the previous DB Snapshot in the resource panel:

#### Read Replica

Currently, only MySQL DB instance supports Read Replica.

Simply click the bottom of the DB instance and drag-n-drop to create:

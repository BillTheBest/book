The [Load Balancers (ELB)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) are some pre-configured instances automatically distributing the incoming traffic across multiple EC2 Instances

Simply drag a load balancer from the Resources panel then drop it outside of the Availability Zones. You can then link the load balancer to the instances<br />
You can configure the load balancers on the right panel

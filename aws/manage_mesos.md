# Apache Mesos

## What is Mesos?

[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.

Project Features
- Scalability to 10,000s of nodes
- Fault-tolerant replicated master and slaves using ZooKeeper
- Support for Docker containers
- Native isolation between tasks with Linux Containers
- Multi-resource scheduling (memory, CPU, disk, and ports)
- Java, Python and C++ APIs for developing new parallel applications
- Web UI for viewing cluster state

## What does VisualOps integration with Mesos do?

When Mesos improves the efficiency of application developers, a large-scale Mesos cluster is sophiscated enough to deploy and manage. Administrators have to spend siginificant amount of efforts and resources on the resource provision, cluster deployment, configuration management and maintainance, etc.

VisualOps' integration with Mesos exponentially simplifies these steps, making anyone could focus infrastructure capacity planning and design, while VisualOps will take care of all heavy lifts.

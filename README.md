## The VisualOps Book
[VisualOps](http://www.visualops.io) is an cloud automation and orchestration tool. It automates:
- infrastructure provisioning
- code deployment
- configuration management

More important, **VisualOps manages your app 24/7 to ensure that the app always run in the desired state, by continually scan the app and instantly fix any drift**.

VisualOps can be used for the following cases:
- Template-based provisioning: fast and repeatable Dev/QA, Demo environment setup
- Continuous Deployment: launch your stack into fully functioning app, VisualOps deploys your code and automatically upgrades it once there is a newer version
- App Ensure: design, launch and relax. VisualOps will ensure your app is always up and running in the state you defined

VisualOps is created with the goal of being "easy to understand" alongside giving you "total control". We believe these two factors are integral to any level of user adopting a new technology. Whether you are running an individual project, startup, ISV, enterprise or anything in between. VisualOps is ideal for managing both small setups with just a handful of instances as well as highly complex environments with thousands.

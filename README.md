## The VisualOps Book
[VisualOps](http://www.visualops.io) is a visual DevOps automation tool. It automates the tasks of resource provisioning, code deployment and configuration management; to ensure that your cloud application always runs in the desired state.

VisualOps is created with the goal of being  **easy to understand** alongside giving you **total control**. We believe these two factors are integral to any level of user adopting a new technology. Whether you are running an individual project, startup, ISV, enterprise or anything in between. VisualOps is ideal for managing both small setups with just a handful of instances as well as highly complex environments with thousands.

**VisualOps continuously ensures the app runs in the defined state by repeatedly verifying the instance configuration and automatically fixing any drift**

Compared with the traditional DevOps solutions, using VisualOps avoids obstacles such asï¼š
>- Needing to learn a new complex tool/DSL
- Having to manually write the recipes
- Hosting and operating a configuration manager master server, like Puppet or Chef
- Requiring integration with the other services, like CloudFormation

**VisualOps gives you a clear view of how your system is setup, as well in depth detail of each instances' configuration**

VisualOps can be used for the following cases:
>- **Template-based provisioning**: fast and repeatable Dev/QA, Demo environment setup
- **Continuous Deployment**: launch your stack into fully functioning app, VisualOps deploys your code and automatically upgrades it once there is a newer version
- **App Ensure**: design, launch and relax. VisualOps will ensure your app is always up and running in the state you defined

# Transfer Stack / App between Workspaces

If you are working in several workspaces, sometime you may want to transfer the stack/app from one workspace to another. To do this, you can:

- export the stack in the source workspace into JSON file
- switch to the target workspace, and import the JSON file as new stack
- [forget the app](../app/forget_app.md) in the source workspace
- [import the same VPC](../app/import.md) in the target workspace (please ensure that the source/target workspaces use the same cloud credential)
